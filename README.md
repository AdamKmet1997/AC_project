# Computer Inteligence Project #

#### Language: ####

Java


The aim of the project is to build a AC system with a Fuzzy Logic and implement different kind of shapes and rules to build the logic so it then works in real examples.

#### Example: ####

Bellow Image how the AC system is beeing implemented and running its Fuzzy Logic. user is then able to change the AC input and depending on AC temperature the room temperature will be trying to match it. If AC is off room temperature will match outside temperature.
